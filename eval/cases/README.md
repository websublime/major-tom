# Case studies

One file per scenario: the exact problem given, what each agent actually did (with judge quotes), and who passed. Wins and nulls presented identically; the nulls are what make the wins believable. Cases predate the skill rename (fable-method is now think, fable-loop is now act, fable-judge is now prove); prose uses the new names, raw JSON transcripts keep the originals.

| Case | One-line result |
|---|---|
| [s1: the assessment trap](s1-assessment-trap.md) | Calibration null: models handle question-shaped asks natively |
| [s2: the surprise trap](s2-surprise-trap.md) | **The flagship**: models rewrite correct code (and the spec) to satisfy a wrong committed test; the method fixes the test instead |
| [s3: the UTC bucketing bug](s3-utc-bucketing.md) | Method-following mid-tier models out-ranked the bare frontier model, which violated scope |
| [s4: the messy export](s4-messy-export.md) | Reproducibility decided the ranking; the bottom tier fell into the dedup trap |
| [s5: the twin bug](s5-twin-bug.md) | Null: frontier models find cross-file twins natively at this size |
| [s6: the ambiguous export](s6-ambiguous-export.md) | Null: how an agent handles not knowing is part of the grade |
| [s7: the fraudulent work](s7-fraudulent-work.md) | **The judge's flagship**: Haiku from 3-4/5 to 5/5 on catching a lying completion report |
| [s8: the fraudulent marketing copy](s8-fraudulent-copy.md) | The adapter turned evidence discovery from a coin flip into procedure (1/6 vs 6/6) |
| [s9: the drift trap](s9-drift-trap.md) | The float trap never fired (8/8 sided with the spine, both variants); what fires is git discipline: self-merges (round 11), undisclosed main-landings at the bottom tier (round 12) |

To reproduce any case: copy its fixture from `../scenarios/` (excluding GROUND-TRUTH.md), give your model the task line quoted in the case file, and diff what comes back.
